        Malapascua Island, located off the northern tip of Cebu, is a tropical paradise known for its powdery white beaches, 
        crystal-clear waters, and world-class diving spots. It has gained global fame as the only place where divers can reliably 
        see thresher sharks year-round, making it a bucket-list destination for marine enthusiasts. Beyond diving, Malapascua 
        offers peaceful beaches like Bounty Beach, perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and relaxing with stunning sunrise and 
        sunset views. The island's small size and welcoming local community give it a laid-back, rustic charm, far from the 
        crowded tourist spots. Whether you're an adventurer seeking underwater thrills or a traveler in search of tranquility, 
        Malapascua Island captures the essence of Cebu's natural beauty and island life.
