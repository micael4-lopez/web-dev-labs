      <p>
        Boracay is the Philippines' most iconic island destination, world-renowned for its powdery white sands, 
        crystal-clear turquoise waters, and vibrant nightlife. At the heart of the island lies White Beach, 
        a 4-kilometer stretch of pristine shoreline often ranked among the best beaches in the world. 
        By day, visitors enjoy swimming, island-hopping, and thrilling water sports like kite surfing, parasailing, and diving.
         As the sun sets, Boracay transforms into a lively hub with beachside dining, fire dances, and 
         music that carries through the night. Beyond the bustling scene, the island also offers quieter escapes 
         at beaches like Puka Shell Beach and panoramic views from Mount Luho. With its perfect mix of relaxation, 
         adventure, and entertainment, Boracay truly lives up to its reputation as the crown jewel of Philippine tourism.
